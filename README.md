# FaceOnVideo
Face detection and recognition experiments 

It reads video from a camera detects faces and try to recognize and lable those using the database that you can fill in
with your prefered images. 

In Mac operating system you can run install parts from the notebook. 
For windows however I found these tips useful: 
1) you would need to install python 3.7 family and not 3.8 at the time of writing this readme. 
2) In order to install Tensorflow use 2.0.0 instead "pip install tensorflow=2.0.0
3) you would need to install visual studio builder to successfully install cmake and face-recognition
